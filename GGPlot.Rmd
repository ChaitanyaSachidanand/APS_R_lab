This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}

library(ggplot2)
plot(cars)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.




#### Read DATA

```{r}
foodData = read.csv('Data/food-texture.csv',header = TRUE,row.names = 1)
head(foodData)
```
#### what kind of data within the datafame
```{r}
typeof(foodData)
```

```{r}
class(foodData)
```
#### very important function to know our data
```{r}
str(foodData)
```
#### Attributes of dataframe
```{r}
nrow(foodData)
ncol(foodData)

```
```{r}
rownames(foodData)
```

```{r}

colnames(foodData)
```
### how to access data in R datafroame
foodData$oil
foodData[['oil]]
foodData[,'oil']
-----till here they give vector
foodData['oil']
-----it give dataframe as output
```{r}
foodData$Oil
```
```{r}
foodData[['Oil']]
```
```{r}
foodData[,'Oil']
```
```{r}
foodData['Oil']
```

```{r}
foodData[,1]
```

#### Factor data structure in R

```{r}
gender = c('Male', 'Female', 'Male','Male')
str(gender)
fact_gnender=(factor(gender))
fact_gnender
```
```{r}
str(fact_gnender)
levels(fact_gnender)
```
#### Add new column called tast with levels 1-poor, 2-fair,3-good, 4-excellent
```{r}
# foodData['Taste']=factor(sample(c('poor','fair','good','excellent'),nrow(foodData),replace = TRUE, p=c(0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25)))
# head(foodData)
```
```{r}
# write.csv(foodData,'Data/food-texture.csv')
```
#### Create list of contineous and catagorical features 
```{r}
contineuos_cols = c( "Oil","Density","Fracture","Hardness" )
catagorical_cols= c("Taste","Crispy")
```
#### all catagorical colums in on shot to factor type(catagorical data type of R)
```{r}
foodData[catagorical_cols]=lapply(foodData[catagorical_cols],factor)
```
```{r}
str(foodData)
```
#### GGplot canvs
```{r}
p= ggplot(data = foodData)
p
```
#### Viz and Understand the relationship b/w 2 contineous variables(scatter plot): oil and density 
```{r}
p = ggplot(data = foodData)+ 
  geom_point(aes(x= Density,y= Oil))
p
```
#### Addding the colour asethetic to plot
```{r}
p = ggplot(data = foodData)+ 
  geom_point(aes(x= Density,y= Oil, color = Crispy))
p
```
```{r}

p = ggplot(data = foodData)+ 
  geom_point(aes(x= Density,y= Oil, size = Crispy))
p
```
```{r}

p = ggplot(data = foodData)+ 
  geom_point(aes(x= Density,y= Oil, size = Crispy,color=Crispy))
p
```

#### Viz and Understand the relationship b/w  contineous variables and catagorical(box plot): crispy and density  
```{r}
p = ggplot(data = foodData)+ 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x= Crispy,y= Density))
p
```
#### udesstanding whats inside a box plot
```{r}
foodData$Density
foodData$Crispy== 10
foodData[foodData$Crispy==10, ]
foodData[foodData$Crispy==10 & foodData$Oil <=17, ]
foodData[foodData$Crispy==10, 'Density' ]
foodData[foodData$Crispy==10, c('Density','Hardness') ]

desnity10 = foodData[foodData$Crispy==10, 'Density' ]
desnity11 = foodData[foodData$Crispy==11, 'Density' ]

```
```{r}
str(desnity10)
desnity10#
desnity10-mean(desnity10)#mean centered density vector
(desnity10-mean(desnity10))^2 ##mean squared centered density vector
mean((desnity10-mean(desnity10))^2)#mean of squared mean centered density vector
#also known as varinace
sqrt(mean((desnity10-mean(desnity10))^2))#SD of the vector
var(desnity10)#variance using inbult function
sd(desnity10)#Standard deviation using inbult function
```
